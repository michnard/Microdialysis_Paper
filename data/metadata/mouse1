Notes on animal 1

Session date: June 19

Recording time: 9:38 – 17:44 (~85min break in the middle)

Total samples collected: 48 (7.5 min interval)

Flow rate: 1.2 µL/min

Probe to tube delay: 14min38sec

Events:

There was a power failure at 16:06. 
the 16th sample of the afternoon (E6) was very small (1uL) and was added to the next one by Nan. 
Within 2 minutes restarted everything. 

At the end of recording, I increased the flow rate to 9 uL/min to quicly recover the dyalisate that was collected during last 7.5min recording.

Processing notes:

Removed behavior 16:06 to 16:08 to correct for the mishap.
